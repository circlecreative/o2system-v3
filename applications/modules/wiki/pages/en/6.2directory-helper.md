### Directory Helper ###

The Directory Helper file contains functions that assist in working with directories.

**Loading this Helper**

This helper is loaded using the following code:

	$this->load->helper('directory');

**Available Functions**

The following functions are available:

	directory_map($source_dir[, $directory_depth = 0[, $hidden = FALSE]])

**Parameters:**
	
- $source_dir (*string*) – Path to the source directory
- $directory_depth (*int*) – Depth of directories to traverse (0 = fully recursive, 1 = current dir, etc)
- $hidden (*bool*) – Whether to include hidden directories

**Returns:** An array of files

**Return type:** array

Examples:

	$map = directory_map('./mydirectory/');

*Note*

> Paths are almost always relative to your main index.php file.

Sub-folders contained within the directory will be mapped as well. If you wish to control the recursion depth, you can do so using the second parameter (integer). A depth of 1 will only map the top level directory:

	$map = directory_map('./mydirectory/', 1);

By default, hidden files will not be included in the returned array. To override this behavior, you may set a third parameter to true (boolean):

	$map = directory_map('./mydirectory/', FALSE, TRUE);

Each folder name will be an array index, while its contained files will be numerically indexed. Here is an example of a typical array:

	Array (
	        [libraries] => Array
	                (
	                        [0] => benchmark.html
	                        [1] => config.html
	                        ["database/"] => Array
	                                (
	                                        [0] => query_builder.html
	                                        [1] => binds.html
	                                        [2] => configuration.html
	                                        [3] => connecting.html
	                                        [4] => examples.html
	                                        [5] => fields.html
	                                        [6] => index.html
	                                        [7] => queries.html
	                                )
	                        [2] => email.html
	                        [3] => file_uploading.html
	                        [4] => image_lib.html
	                        [5] => input.html
	                        [6] => language.html
	                        [7] => loader.html
	                        [8] => pagination.html
	                        [9] => uri.html

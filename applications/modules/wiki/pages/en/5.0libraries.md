### Developer Library ###
------------------------
Usually for send output to the browser we are using this kind of methods:

```
echo '<pre>'.print_r($array).'</pre>'; die;
// or
echo '<pre>' var_dump($array); die;
``` 

With O2System Developer Helper you can do much shorter, much better look also you can see the debug back traces.

```
print_out(string | array | object | bool, (bool) $halt); // by default $halt is set to TRUE same with die();
// or 
print_dump(string | array | object | bool, (bool) $halt);
// or
print_lines(string | array | object | bool, (bool) $halt); // for print combined lines, $halt it's set to FALSE by default - set it into TRUE when you need the print line to be stopped - you can call it everywhere
// or
console(\O2System::L_INFO, string | array | object | bool, (string) $title) // for send output to browser console instead to browser screen
```
> Avaliable developer function: print_out, print_dump, print_code, console, Debug::line(), etc. 

### Template Engine Driver ###
O2System featured with built-in Template Engine Driver that can be Template Engine easily integrated with other like: [Smarty Template Engine](http://www.smarty.net/ "Smarty Official Website"), [Dwoo Template Engine](http://dwoo.org "Dwoo Official Website") and [Twig Template Engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/ "Twig Official Website") (coming soon: Blade and Mustache Template Engine Template Engine) which you easily install in [O2System Framework](http://o2system.center "O2System Official Website") using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org "Composer Official Website") and after you install your can immediately use only by doing template configuration settings, without having to bother to create additional libraries. The [O2System Framework](http://o2system.center "O2System Official Website") default Template Parser is [Lex Parser](https://github.com/pyrocms/lex) from [Pyro CMS](http://pyrocms.com) and also already equipped with [Markdown Parser](http://parsedown.org) and Shortcodes Parser (WordPress Shortcodes Like).

#!php
<ul>
<?php foreach ($addressbook as $name):?>
        <li><?=$name?></li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
```

Contrast this with the pseudo-code used by a template engine:

```
<ul>
{{foreach from=$contacts item="name"}}
        <li>{{$name}}</li>
{{/foreach}}
</ul>
```
Yes, the template engine example is a bit cleaner, but it comes at the price of performance, as the pseudo-code must be converted back into PHP to run. Since one of our goals is maximum performance, we opted to not require the use of a template engine.

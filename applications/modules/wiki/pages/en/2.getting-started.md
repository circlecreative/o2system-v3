## Getting Started ##
---------------------

### Basic Knowledge ###
-----------------------
If you have experience using CodeIgniter it's won't be a big problems for understanding O2System. Basically O2System can become as alternative framework for building your web-based application. Much has same syntax with CodeIgniter, for reference you can read also [CodeIgniter User Guide](http://codeigniter.com/userguides3/).

### Main Concept ###
--------------------
Basically O2System has same concept with CodeIgniter it has Super Global Object, \O2System::instance() function. The different are CodeIgniter is based on MVC only (Model-View-Controller) to do Modularity you must add third_party HMVC plugin into CodeIgniter such as O2System HMVC plugin for CodeIgniter and only support for single application building, O2System is based on HMVC (Hierarchical-Model-View-Controller) so is already supported for Modularity and with O2System you can built multi-application in one integrated core system.

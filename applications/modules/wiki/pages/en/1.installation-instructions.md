## Installation Instructions ##
------------------------------

### Server Requirements ###
Only work on PHP 5.4 or newer is recommended.

A database is required for most web application programming. Currently supported databases are:

- MySQL (5.1+) via the mysql (deprecated), mysqli and pdo drivers
- Oracle via the oci8 and pdo drivers
- PostgreSQL via the postgre and pdo drivers
- MS SQL via the mssql, sqlsrv (version 2005 and above only) and pdo drivers
- SQLite via the sqlite (version 2), sqlite3 (version 3) and pdo drivers
- CUBRID via the cubrid and pdo drivers
- Interbase/Firebird via the ibase and pdo drivers
- ODBC via the odbc and pdo drivers (you should know that ODBC is actually an abstraction layer)

> Powered with CodeIgniter Database Drivers (Porting)

### Manual Installation ###

O2System Framework is installed in four steps:

1. Unzip the package.
2. Upload the O2System folders and files to your server. Normally the index.php file will be at your root.
3. Open the applications/config/config.php file with a text editor. Set the configuration based on your needs.
4. If you intend to use a database, open the applications/config/database.php file with a text editor and set your database settings.

If you wish to increase security by hiding the location of your O2System files you can rename the system and application folders to something more private. If you do rename them, you must open your main index.php file and set the $system_path and $apps_path variables at the top of the file with the new name you’ve chosen.

You can also define BASEAPP on index.php if you wish set default application instead using the main application.

For the best security, both the system and any application folders should be placed above web root so that they are not directly accessible via a browser. By default, .htaccess files are included in each folder to help prevent direct access, but it is best to remove them from public access entirely in case the web server configuration changes or doesn’t abide by the .htaccess.

One additional measure to take in production environments is to disable PHP error reporting and any other development-only functionality. In O2System, this can be done by setting the ENVIRONMENT constant, which is more fully described on the security page.

That’s it!

If you’re new to O2System, please read the Getting Started section of the User Guide to begin learning how to build dynamic PHP applications. Enjoy!

### Composer Installation ###
1. To do this first, you must has [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) installation at your server. Please read the manual, documentation on the [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) website for more details.
2. Open php shell and write (for further information about the package please visit [O2System Packagist Page](https://packagist.org/packages/o2system/o2system)

```
php cd your/public/www/
php composer require: "o2system/o2system:dev3-master"
```

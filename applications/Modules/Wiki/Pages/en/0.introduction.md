# Welcome to O2System #
-----------------------
[O2System Framework](http://o2system.center "O2System Official Website") is an Applications Development Framework, to build a web sites or web-based applications using PHP as the programming language. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries, if you previously had been using [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website") would be very easy to switch to [O2System Framework](http://o2system.center "O2System Official Website"). O2System lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.

```
php cd your/public/www/
php composer require: "o2system/o2system:dev3-master"
```

## Introduction ##
------------------
### Who is O2System For? ###
If you want to build a site that is equipped with multiple web-based applications or you want to build multiple web-based applications and integrated with each other, then [O2System Framework](http://o2system.center "O2System Official Website") is right for you.

### History of O2System ###
In 2009 O2System is a closed source PHP Framework is intended to build O2CMS (Website Content Management System) but the project was discontinued in 2011, which later in 2012 became the third party HMVC for [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website"), but not distributed and still a closed source. In 2014, the directors of PT. Lingkar Kreasi (Circle Creative) finally decided to redevelop O2System to became an Open Source PHP Framework and no longer as a third party of [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website").

### Open Source ###
O2System is licensed under MIT-License so you can use it however you please. For more information please read the [license agreement](#License).

### Semantic Versioning ###
O2System is now versioning based on [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). Current stable version is 3.0.0

### Light Weight ###
Truly light weight. The core system requires only a few very small libraries. This is in stark contrast to many frameworks that require significantly more resources. Additional libraries are loaded dynamically upon request, based on your needs for a given process, so the base system is very lean and quite fast.

### Blazingly Fast ###
Really fast. We challenge you to find a framework that has better performance than O2System.

### Uses HMVC ###
O2System uses the Hierarchical-Model-View-Controller approach, which allows great separation with modularity between logic and presentation. This is particularly good for projects in which designers are working with your template files, as the code these files contain will be minimized. We describe HMVC in more detail on its own page.

### Search Engine Friendly ###
The URLs generated by O2System are clean and search-engine friendly. Rather than using the standard “query string” approach to URLs that is synonymous with dynamic systems.

### Powerfull Libraries ###
O2System comes with full-range of libraries that enable the most commonly needed web development tasks, like accessing a database, sending email, validating form data, maintaining sessions, manipulating images, combining with CodeIgniter Framework Libraries and other third party libraries.

### Extensible ###
The system can be easily extended through the use of your own libraries, helpers, or through class extensions or system hooks.

### Powerful Features ### 
Features in and of themselves are a very poor way to judge an application since they tell you nothing about the user experience, or how intuitively or intelligently it is designed. Features don’t reveal anything about the quality of the code, or the performance, or the attention to detail, or security practices. The only way to really judge an app is to try it and get to know the code. Installing O2System is child’s play so we encourage you to do just that. In the mean time here’s a list of O2System’s main features.

### Easy Porting from [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website") ###
We understand that switch to the new PHP Framework is very painful, require new adaptations, read many documentations and tutorials, and the biggest problem is if we have had a lot of source code that still we want to use, especially code that we have made over the [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website"). In [O2System Framework](http://o2system.center "O2System Official Website") your existing source code can be easily integrated, with a few changes off course but very easy. Basically [O2System Framework](http://o2system.center "O2System Official Website") use the same syntax with [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website"), and came with a lot off new features that would be very helpful for your project.

### The Difference from [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website") ###
1. [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website") built with the basic concepts as the Framework MVC (Model-View-Controller), while O2System built with the basic concepts as HMVC Framework (Hierarchical Model-View-Controller) and the concept of Modular.
2. [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website") is designed to be used to build single application only, while O2System designed to be used for building multiple applications that can be integrated each others in a single Core System.
3. [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website") is not using namespace, while O2System already using namespace.
4. [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website") doesn't have Autoload, while O2System already use the concept PSR-0 Autoload, even in O2System you can define your own namespace for each application, module, component, plugins or widgets.
5. [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website") doesn't have a registry structure, while O2System registry structure used as the basis of the O2System PSR-0 Autoloader.
6. [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website") only the Template Parser while O2System has Template Engine Driver that can be Template Engine easily integrated with other like: [Smarty Template Engine](http://www.smarty.net/ "Smarty Official Website"), [Dwoo Template Engine](http://dwoo.org "Dwoo Official Website") and [Twig Template Engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/ "Twig Official Website") (coming soon: Blade and Mustache Template Engine Template Engine) which you easily install in [O2System Framework](http://o2system.center "O2System Official Website") using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org "Composer Official Website") and after you install your can immediately use only by doing template configuration settings, without having to bother to create additional libraries. The [O2System Framework](http://o2system.center "O2System Official Website") default Template Parser is [Lex Parser](https://github.com/pyrocms/lex) from [Pyro CMS](http://pyrocms.com) and also already equipped with [Markdown Parser](http://parsedown.org) and Shortcodes Parser (WordPress Shortcodes Like).

### Conclusion ###
If you want to have the convenience of [CodeIgniter Framework](http://codeigniter.com "CodeIgniter Official Website") and also Laravel Framework alike advantages, [O2System Framework](http://o2system.center "O2System Official Website") is a framework that is appropriate for you.

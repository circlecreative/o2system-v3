<h3>Behind The Scene</h3>
Why based on Codeigniter Framework?<br>
Basically CodeIgniter is the most popular framework and has very good documentation, forum and etc. CodeIgniter has concept for Super Global Object and Get Instance this is really need by us on the O2System Framework. We know also that shifting into another framework is really need new adaptation, reading many documentation, get to learn from tutorial and the big problem is if you had a bunch of codes that you need to use and is all on CodeIgniter version.

The bottom lines is we create this new framework to fullfill our and your needs for building best web based application with HMVC (Hierarchical model–view–controller) concept. With O2System you can done it in the wright way, because you can build very modular modules, parenting classess, integrated applications in one framework system, and many other features.
